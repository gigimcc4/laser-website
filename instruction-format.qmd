### Course Overview

As the use of digital resources continues to expand in education, an unprecedented amount of new data is becoming available to educational researchers and practitioners. In response, Learning Analytics (LA) has emerged over the past decade as an interdisciplinary field encompassing Learning (e.g. educational technology, learning and assessment sciences), Analytics (e.g. visualization, computer/data sciences), and Human-Centered Design (e.g. usability, participatory design).

This course will provide students with an overview of the field, examples of its use in educational contexts, and applied experience with tools and techniques for analyzing new sources of data from new perspectives. As participants gain experience in the collection, analysis, and reporting of data throughout the course, they will be better prepared to help educational organizations understand and improve learning and the contexts in which learning occurs.

**Number of Credits:** 3

**Course Prerequisites/Co-requisites:** This course has no prerequisites.

### Time & Location

**Meeting Time:** This distance education course is predominantly asynchronous. Online tools are utilized throughout the course for communication and interaction. In addition, we will use Zoom for synchronous virtual office hours, web conferencing, or whole class discussions. For optional live class meet-ups, I will send out a poll the first week of class to find a time that works for the majority of students and record these meetings for students who are not able to attend.

**Virtual Class Locations:** All course materials and activities can be accessed online through NC State’s Moodle course management platform. Access <http://wolfware.ncsu.edu/> and log-in with your Unity ID and password. After logging-in, locate and click on ECI 586 An Introduction to Learning Analytics to access the course site.

#### **Major Assignments & Assessment**

1.  **Housekeeping (4 pts)**: Students will review the syllabus and “sign” the Online Learner Agreement sent at the beginning of the semester that outlines expectations for participating in an online course. Student will also be required to install necessary software and post a brief introduction of themselves and respond to their peers. 

2.  **Reading & Discussion (24 pts)**: The first week of each unit introduces terminology, core concepts, and applications of an analytical approach through readings, course videos, and discussion. To help guide discussions, students are provided a set of essential questions to address and are also encouraged to explore their own areas of interest. The primary goal of course readings and discussion is to foster a deeper understanding of how Learning Analytics has been applied in educational contexts.

3.  **R Toolkit Tutorials (24 pts):** The second week of each unit, consists of tutorials for working with R packages and functions used import, wrangle, explore, and model data. The primary goal of these tutorials is to support familiarity and fluency with R syntax and key functions for data analysis.

4.  **Case Studies (24 pts)**: In the third week of each unit, students will complete an interactive “case study” demonstrating how key data-intensive research workflow processes (i.e., wrangling, visualizing, summarizing, modeling, and communicating data) featured in exemplary education research studies are implemented in R. Coding case studies also provide a holistic setting to explore important foundational LA topics integral to data analysis such as reproducible research, use of APIs, ethical considerations, diversity and inclusion, and creation of useful data products.

5.  **Final Project (24 pts)**: In lieu of a final exam, students will conduct and independent analysis using a data source of their choosing and create a “data product” (e.g. report, presentation, data dashboard, etc.) demonstrating the knowledge and skills gained throughout the semester.

**Grading Scale:** The grading scale is based on 100 points:

A+ (97-100), A (94-96), A- (90-93), B+ (87-89), B (84-86), B- (80-83)

C+ (77-79), C (74-76), C- (70-73), D+ (67-69), D (64-66), D- (60-63), F (59 or less)

Late work is accepted but may be penalized at 15% per week it is late. Assignments submitted by the due date, however, may be revised and resubmitted for a higher grade by the following week. Students experiencing unforeseen circumstances with a resulting excused absence (e.g., family medical emergency) are allowed to make up work without penalty.

**Course Feedback Expectations:** Please contact your instructor via email (shaun.kellogg\\\@ncsu.edu) with any questions about the course project or other assignments. Your instructor will strive to answer any emails within 24 hours (M-F) and 48 hours on the weekend, and grade submitted assignments within 5-7 days of the due date. In addition, students will be provided ongoing opportunities, and are strongly encouraged, to provide course feedback to help improve the design of current and future course implementations.

## Overview

The purpose of this interactive workshop is to provide a hands-on introduction to curriculum developed as part of the Learning Analytics in STEM Education Research (LASER) Institute, a professional development program for early and mid-career researchers funded by the National Science Foundation (ECR: BCSER). The intended audience for this workshop includes early-career and experienced scholars seeking who currently teach, or have a desire to teach, learning analytics methodologies. **The primary aim of this workshop is to support participants interested in incorporating LASER curriculum materials into webinars, workshops, courses or programs at their home institution.**

Participants in this workshop will learn about the design and structure of the 25+ learning modules covering a range of topics and techniques like machine learning, network analysis, and text mining. Participants will also gain hands-on experience with instructional activities such as conceptual overviews, interactive code-alongs, tutorials, case studies using Python and R, essential readings and discussion activities, and badging and microcredential opportunities. Finally, participants will learn pedagogical tips and information on the computing infrastructure, technology stack, and logistics required for leveraging these materials for their own undergraduate, graduate or professional learning programs.

## Background

To help address this need for researchers trained in LA and related methods, the Learning Analytics in STEM Education Research (LASER) Institute was developed with the primary goal of increasing the number and the capacity of scholars capable of leveraging new data sources and computational methods (e.g., network analysis, text mining and machine learning) to support their research. With a new round of funding from the National Science Foundation (ECR: BCSER), North Carolina State University and the University of Pennsylvania are refining, expanding, and repackaging instructional resources developed for the LASER Institute into "turnkey" curriculum materials that can be used and adapted by faculty in higher education to prepare the next generation of STEM scholars. 

## Workshop Activities

The workshop will kick-off with a 30 minute introductory presentation that provides an overview of the purpose and goals of LASER Institute, including lessons learned from two virtual and one in-person cohorts of participating scholars.

Part 1 of the workshop will provide participant hands-on experience with the following types of instructional activities included in each curriculum module:

-   **Interactive Presentations**. Each module contains slide decks for two interactive presentations: the first consisting of a conceptual overview of key terminology, techniques, and applications; the second presentation providing a short but highly structured code-along activity that demonstrates key packages and functions required for specific data analysis techniques. 

-   **Coding Case Studies**. These interactive coding experiences can be completed by learners independently or in small groups and demonstrate key data-intensive research workflow processes (i.e., wrangling, visualizing, summarizing, modeling, and communicating data). 

-   **Readings and Discussion**. Essential readings are curated for participants to help them dive deeper into LA concepts, techniques, and applications introduced in presentation and case studies.

-   **Software Tutorials**. Openly accessible software tutorials are curated for each module and are intended to help learners develop technical proficiency with essential software packages, functions, and programming syntax.  

-   **Badges & Microcredentials**. Each module includes a summative assessment activity designed to help learners reflect on how the concepts and techniques introduced in each lab might apply to their own STEM education research, where they can demonstrate their technical proficiency with the analytical techniques and methods addressed in each unit.

Part 2 of the workshop will consist of a presentation, facilitated discussion, and guided planning activities designed to support participants in setting up learning environments and adapting these materials for webinars, workshops, or courses at their home institution. 

## Workshop Goals

The half-day workshop serves as an extension of the LASER Institute, with the primary goal of equipping participants with high-quality curriculum materials that can be used to train faculty and students at their home institutions. To achieve this goal, this workshop is organized into three parts. Part 1 introduces participants to the curriculum materials developed by the LASER team and provides hands-on activities to help participants understand curriculum content and instructional design. Part 2 focuses on the technology infrastructure required for teaching with these materials including set up for Posit Cloud, R Studio, and Quarto. In addition, facilitators will help participants select appropriate modules for their instructional goals and develop a tentative plan to use curriculum materials for webinars, workshops, and courses at their university or research institutions. 

Finally, we recognize that there is always room for improving these curriculum materials, particularly after use in a wider range of instructional settings. Therefore, a secondary aim of this workshop is to gather feedback from participating scholars both during and after the workshop to further refine the curriculum materials. Specifically, we will incorporate opportunities throughout the workshop to solicit feedback from participants on how curriculum materials might be improved or adapted to better fit their local context and meet the needs of learners at their home institutions.

## Post Workshop Engagement

Participants will be invited to join the LASER community hub on Slack, which serves as a platform for building a community of practice and staying updated on future LASER events, resources and information. In addition, participants will be invited to participate in follow-up surveys designed to assess in what ways, and to what extent, participants have incorporated LASER curriculum materials into their own teaching and to gather feedback for improving these materials.
